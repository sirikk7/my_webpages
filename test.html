          <h3>C language</h3>
          <p>
            The C programming language is a general-purpose, high-level language
            that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the
            UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first
            implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.

          <p>Structured language</p>
          <p>It produces efficient programs.</p>

          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p>
            Java is a computer programming language. It enables programmers to
            write computer instructions using English-based commands instead of
            having to write in numeric codes. Itâ€™s known as a high-level
            language because it can be read and written easily by humans.
          </p>
          <p>Java is Object Oriented</p>
          <p>
            The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine
            independent code)
          </p>
          <p>Java syntax is similar to C/C++</p>

          <p>
            A computer programming language is a language used to write computer
            programs, which involves a computer performing some kind of
            computation or algorithm and possibly control external devices such
            as printers, disk drives, robots and so on
          </p>

          <h3>Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
            conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
            often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm
          </p>
          <p>It has curly-bracket syntax</p>
          <p>Dynamic typing</p>
          <p>Prototype-based object-orientation</p>
